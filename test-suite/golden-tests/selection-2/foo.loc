module main (foo)

-- This should compile to exactly the same code as selection-1.
-- The only difference is that it uses an extra module, Arithmetic, to abstract
-- away the concrete language imports, this is likely to be a common pattern.

import types (Real)
import Arithmetic (add)

foo x y = add x (add y 42.0)
