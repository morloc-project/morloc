type Fasta = (Str, Str)

-- eventually I need something like OverLoadedStrings extension, so that I can
-- make strings like `x-*/*.loc` that are then parsed into globs. Or just use
-- functions. Since vanilla functions suffice, this really is no priority.
type Filename = ?

-- effects - from Koka
-- * IO
-- * NDet
-- * Console
-- * Exp
-- * Div

read_fasta :: Filename -> <IO> Fasta
write_fasta :: Fasta -> Filename -> <IO> ()

warn_read :: Filename -> <IO,Console> String

-- read up on Koka, try actually writing something in that language

-- generic effects versus constant effects, capitalization? Or do I ever need to specify it?
