module main (foo)

-- A function may be imported from multiple modules. The compiler is
-- responsible for deciding which of the available implementations to use.
--
-- In the case below, C++ should be selected for both `add` instances, since
-- C++ is the faster language.

import types (Real)
import pybase (add)
import cppbase (add)
