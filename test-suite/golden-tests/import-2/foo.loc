-- test for gitub issue #16

-- The index for `person` should link to the scope where person was defined

-- Since `person` was defined in `localmap`, it should have access to `Map`,
-- `List`, and all the other type terms defined there. These types should not
-- need to be imported here. Indeed, if they are imported here from other sources,
-- there should be no conflict.

module foo (person)
import localmap (person)
